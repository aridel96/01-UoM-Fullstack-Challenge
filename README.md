# 01-UoM-Fullstack-Challenge

## Description
Challenge Project 1 from the University of Minnesota Fullstack Coding Bootcamp

This project focuses on refactoring the provided code and adjusting it to create a more accessible site. By making the site more accessible not only does this make the site easier to use, but it also helps improve search engine optimization.  

Through this project I've learned about many key aspects of Web Development. I learned the importance of semantic HTML elements and the difference compared to non-semantic elements. I also learned how HTML features such as logical page structure, element attributes, and even styling can all play an important role in making a site more accessable. I also learned the role that accessability has in terms of improving SEO and how by making a site more accessible it "helps search engine algorithms understand the content better and improve searchability".
